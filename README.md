# Plant Disease Detection App

This app can detect different types of diseases in the plants.

I have trained the model for detecting disease like early blight and late blight in potato plant by analysing the affected leaf.

## Tools used:

For training the model I have used dataset available on kaggle you can see it- [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)

I have imported camera and tflite plugins for creating this project.
